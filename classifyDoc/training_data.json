The Receiver will cooperate with the Assuming \nInstitution to remove any Liens in favor of the Federal Reserve Banks and Federal Home Loan \nBanks on any Acquired Assets. \n3.2. \nAsset Purchase Price. \n(a) \nDetermination of Asset Purchase Price. All Acquired Assets and assets of \nthe Failed Bank subject to an option to purchase by the Assuming Institution will be purchased for \nthe amount, or the amount resulting from the method specified for determining the amount, as \nspecified on Schedule 3 \n.2, except as otherwise may be provided in this Agreement. Any Acquired \nAsset for which no purchase price is specified on Schedule 3 \n.2 or otherwise in this Agreement will \nbe purchased at its Book Value. The purchase price for Acquired Subsidiaries will be adjusted \npursuant to Section 4.6(i)(iv), if applicable. \n(b) \nPurchase Price for Securities. The purchase price of any security ( \nother than \nthe capital stock of any Acquired Subsidiary, Federal Home Loan Bank stock, repossessed \nsecurities, and any Qualified Financial Contract that constitutes a security) purchased under \nSection 3.1 by the Assuming Institution consists of the market price (as defined below) of the \nsecurity as of the Bank Closing Date, multiplied by the Failed Bank's ownership interest in the \nsecurity (see Calculation of Purchase Price below) and includes accrued interest, where applicable, \nas noted below. \n(i) \nDefinition of Market Price: The market price of any security is (i) \nthe market price for that security quoted at the close of the trading day effective on the \nBank Closing Date as published electronically by Bloomberg, L.P., or alternatively, at the \n1 8  \ndiscretion of the Receiver, by Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) Data Services' Continuous \nEvaluated Pricing Services (CEP), or (ii) provided that if that market price is not available \nfor that security, the Receiver will notify the Assuming Institution and the Assuming \nInstitution will submit a purchase price bid for that security within three (3) days of \nnotification (unless the Assuming Institution and the Receiver agree to a different time \nperiod) and the Receiver, in its sole and absolute discretion, will accept or reject that \npurchase price bid. In the absence of a market price or an acceptable purchase price bid \nfrom the Assuming Institution, or if a security is deemed essential to the Receiver as \ndetermined by the Receiver in its discretion under Section 3.6 of this Agreement, that \nsecurity will not pass to the Assuming Institution and will be an excluded asset under this \nAgreement and listed on Schedule 3.5(1). \n(ii) \nCalculation of Purchase Price: The bank's ownership interest in a \nsecurity will be quantified as either: (i) number of shares or other units, as applicable (in \nthe case of equity securities) or (ii) par value or notational amount, as applicable (in the \ncase of non-equity securities). As a result, the purchase price ( \nexcept where determined \npursuant to clause (ii) of the preceding paragraph) will be calculated as either, depending \non whether or not the security is an equity security: (i) the purchase price for an equity \nsecurity will be calculated by multiplying the number of shares or other units by the \napplicable market price per unit; and (ii) the purchase price for a non-equity security will \nbe an amount equal to the applicable market price ( \nexpressed as a decimal), multiplied by \nthe par value for that security (based on the payment factor most recently widely available). \nThe purchase price also will include accrued interest as calculated in accordance with the \nfollowing paragraph, except to the extent the parties may otherwise expressly agree \npursuant to clause (ii) of the preceding paragraph. If the factor used to determine the par \nvalue of any security for purposes of calculating the purchase price, is not for the period in \nwhich the Bank Closing Date occurs, then the purchase price for that security will be \nsubject to adjustment post-closing based on a \"cancel and correct\" procedure. Under this \nprocedure, after that current factor becomes publicly available, the Receiver will \nrecalculate the purchase price utilizing the current factor and related interest rate, and will \nnotify the Assuming Institution of any difference and of the applicable amount due from \none party to the other. The resulting amount will then be paid as part of the settlement \nprocess pursuant to Article VIII. \n(iii) \nCalculation of Accrued Interest for Securities: Accrued interest will \nbe calculated for a non-equity security by multiplying the interest rate ( \nexpressed as a \ndecimal point) paid on the security as then most recently publicly available, by the most \nrecent par value ( \nor notational amount, as applicable) of that security, multiplied by the \nnumber of days from and including the first interest day of the accrual period in which the \nBank Closing Date occurs, through the Bank Closing Date. \n(c) \nPurchase Price for Qualified Financial Contracts. Qualified Financial \nContracts that are Transferred QFCs will be valued and purchased at QFC Contract Value (positive \nor negative). The Receiver and the Assuming Institution will equally share any costs associated \nwith the determination of QFC Contract Value. \n1 9  \n3.3. \nManner of Conveyance; Limited Warranty; Nonrecourse; Etc. \nTHE \nCONVEYANCE OF ALL ACQUIRED ASSETS, INCLUDING REAL AND PERSONAL \nPROPERTY INTERESTS, PURCHASED BY THE ASSUMING INSTITUTION UNDER \nTHIS AGREEMENT WILL BE MADE, AS NECESSARY, BY RECEIVER'S DEED OR \nRECEIVER'S BILL OF SALE AND, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE SPECIFICALLY \nPROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT, \"AS IS\", \"WHERE IS\", WITHOUT RECOURSE, \nWITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER WITH RESPECT TO THOSE \nACQUIRED ASSETS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO TITLE, VALUE, \nCOLLECTIBILITY, \nGENUINENESS, \nENFORCEABILITY, \nDOCUMENTATION, \nCONDITION, OR FREEDOM FROM LIENS OR ENCUMBRANCES (IN WHOLE OR IN \nPART), OR ANY OTHER MATTERS. \n3.4. \nPuts of Assets to the Receiver. \n(a) \nPuts After the Bank Closing Date. \n(i) \nDuring the sixty (60)-day period following the Bank Closing Date \n(which sixty (60)-day period may be extended in writing in the sole and absolute discretion \nof the Receiver for any Loan), the Assuming Institution may require the Receiver to \npurchase (x) any Deposit Secured Loan transferred to the Assuming Institution pursuant to \nSection 3.1 that is not fully secured by Assumed Deposits or deposits at other insured \ndepository institutions due to either insufficient Assumed Deposit or deposit collateral or \ndeficient documentation regarding that collateral or (y) any New Loan; provided that, (I) \nthe Assuming Institution may not require under this Section 3.4(a) the purchase of a \nDeposit Secured Loan that is secured by an Assumed Deposit until any Deposit setoff \ndetermination, whether voluntary or involuntary, has been made and (11) the Assuming \nInstitution may not require the purchase of any Loan (x) that is a Transferred QFC, or (y) \nin respect of which a Related Liability constituting a Transferred QFC exists. \n(ii) \nDuring the forty ( \n40)-day period following the Bank Closing Date, \nthe Assuming Institution may require the Receiver to purchase, any Eligible Overdraft \ntransferred to the Assuming Institution pursuant to Section 3.1 that existed on the thirtieth \n(30th) day following the Bank Closing Date. \n(iii) \nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the Assuming Institution may not \nrequire the Receiver to purchase any Loan pursuant to Section 3.4(a) if (x) the Obligor with \nrespect to that Loan is an Acquired Subsidiary or (y) the Assuming Institution has: \n(A) \nmade any advance in accordance with the terms of a \nCommitment or otherwise with respect to that Loan; \n(B) \ntaken any action that caused an increase in the amount of a \nRelated Liability with respect to that Loan; \n(C) \ncreated or permitted to be created any Lien on that Loan that \nsecures indebtedness for money borrowed or that constitutes a conditional sales \nagreement, capital lease or other title retention agreement; \n20 \n(D) \nentered into, agreed to make, grant or permit, or made, \ngranted or permitted any modification or amendment to, any waiver or extension \nwith respect to, or any renewal, refinancing or refunding of, that Loan or related \nCredit Documents or collateral, including any act or omission that \ndiminished that collateral; or \n(E) \nsold, assigned, or transferred all or a portion of that Loan to \na third party (whether with or without recourse). \n(b) \nPuts Prior to the Settlement Date.

In accordance with Section 3.2(c), in preparing the Pro Forma Statement each \nQualified Financial Contract will be included at QFC Contract Value (positive or negative) and, if \na Qualified Financial Contract is a liability, no further liability amount will be included for \npurposes of preparing the Pro F \norma Statement. \n8.2. \nCorrection of Errors and Omissions; Adiustments for Certain Liabilities. \n(a) \nAdjustments to Correct Errors.

If the Assuming Institution returns all \nor a portion of any Deposit to the Receiver or the Corporation at the direction of the Receiver or \nthe Corporation pursuant to Section 9.5, the Receiver will make appropriate adjustments pursuant \nto Article VIII for the portion of the Bid Amount applicable to that returned Deposit and any related \nDeposit premium. \n(c) \nOther Adjustments. If the Failed Bank transferred, after the Bid Valuation \nDate, an asset to a Subsidiary that is not an Acquired Subsidiary and the Assuming Institution \nwould have purchased that asset under Section 3 \n.1 but for that transfer, the Receiver will make an \nadjustment to the Initial Payment (or subsequent payments) in an amount equal to (i) the Book \nValue of that transferred asset divided by (ii) the Book Value of all Acquired Assets plus the Book \nValue of that transferred asset plus the Book Value of other similarly transferred assets, then \nmultiplied by (iii) the Acquired Asset premium (discount) bid set forth in Article VII. This \nadjustment will be as a credit to the Assuming Institution in the case of an Acquired Asset premium \nbid and a credit to the Receiver in the case of an Acquired Asset discount bid. For purposes of this \nSection 8.2(c), Book Value means, solely with respect to the applicable asset transferred to a \nSubsidiary that is not an Acquired Subsidiary, that value stated on the Failed Bank Records as of \nthe Bid Valuation Date. \n8.3. \nPayments. Either the Receiver will cause to be paid to the Assuming Institution or \nthe Assuming Institution will pay to the Receiver, as the case may be, on the Settlement Date, a \npayment in an amount that reflects net adjustments (including any costs, expenses, and fees \nassociated with determinations of value as provided in this Agreement) made pursuant to Section \n8.1 or Section 8.2, plus interest as provided in Section 8.4.

Upon payment by the Receiver, or the Corporation as guarantor in \naccordance with Section 12. \n7, to any Indemnitee for any claims indemnified by the Receiver under \n52 \nthis Article XII, the Receiver, or the Corporation as appropriate, will become subrogated to all \nrights of the Indemnitee against any other Person to the extent of that payment. \nARTICLE XIII. \nMISCELLANEOUS. \n13.1. \nCosts, Fees, and Expenses.

The FDIC makes this \ndistinction to facilitate its role as Receiver and Insurer. \nNon-DTC Brokered Deposits pass to the Assuming Institution, but they are excluded from \nAssumed Deposits when the deposit premium is calculated. Please see the attached \"Schedule 7 \u00ad\nNon-DTC Broker Deposit Detail Report\" for a listing of these accounts. This list will be updated \npost-closing with balances as of the Bank Closing Date. \nIf [Failed Bank] had any brokered deposit accounts with Cede & Co as Nominee for DTC, they \nare excluded from Assumed Deposits in the Purchase and Assumption Agreement. \nII. \nNon-Brokered Reciprocal Deposits and Non-Brokered Sweep Deposits \nNon-brokered reciprocal deposits and non-brokered sweep deposits pass to the Assuming \nInstitution, but they are excluded from Assumed Deposits when the deposit premium is calculated. \n[Failed Bank] did not participate in any network program as of the date of the deposit download. \nIf non-brokered deposits are taken between the date of the deposit download and the Bank Closing \nDate, they will be identified post-closing and made part of Schedule 7 to the Purchase and \nAssumption Agreement. \nIII. \nListing Service Deposits \nListing service deposits are deposits that may have been solicited via a money desk, internet \nsubscription service (for example, QwickRate\u00ae), or similar programs. \n72 \n[Failed Bank] does have QwickRate\u00ae deposits as identified above. [Please see the attached \n\"Schedule 7 - QwickRate\u00ae Deposit Detail Report\" for a listing of these accounts as of, 20_.] \nThis list will be updated post-closing with balances as of the Bank Closing Date. \nThis schedule provides account categories and balances as of the date of the deposit download, or \nas indicated.
